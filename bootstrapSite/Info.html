<h1>How to Grow Baseball</h1>

<h4>Baseball has been around since 1846. The first season of MLB was in 1869. Since the first one in 1903, there has been a World Series every year(excluding 1904 and 1994). Baseball is called America’s pastime, as it has been a cultural phenomenon in America. It was the first sport to become a huge deal in America. Yet, it has been outshined by other sports such as football and more recently basketball. Most concerning is the decline in popularity among the younger audience. If you were to go ask an average kid if they know who Mike Trout is, they wouldn’t know who he is. Trout is the best player in all of baseball and has been for a while. Baseball is perceived to be boring, no one wants to watch it. This is not good for the growth of the game. What are the solutions to this problem? One is marketing. Most of baseball’s big stars like Trout are not marketed nearly enough. There are a number of young stars that can be marketed as the future of baseball, like Fernando Tatis Jr, Vladimir Guerrero Jr, Juan Soto and more. Another solution is to fix the pace of play for games to make them more exciting. One obvious fix that the MLB hasn’t implemented is to limit the number of warmup pitches in between innings. Advertisements are much more frequent in baseball compared to other sports, and there isn’t a way to fix that because of how the game works. With 9 innings, there are 17 or 18 half innings without extra innings. Also, bullpen changes add more breaks. Those breaks can be shortened to a minute or less if they limit the number of warmup pitches. Pitchers entering the game get 8 pitches for warmups, and returning pitchers get 5. If it’s limited to 5 for new pitchers and 3 for returning, that would save time. You could even lower it even more, to 3 for new and 1 for returning. That would limit the time of breaks, and keep people more engaged with the game. But ultimately, marketing is truly the best way to grow baseball. Name recognition is key for basketball and football stars, it needs to be similar for baseball.</h4>
